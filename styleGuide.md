# Code Style Guide

## Naming

- Classes and structs will begin with an uppercase letter
- All words in a class will be capitalised
- Methods, functions, and arguments should use snake_case
- Macros should use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Spelling should use English (UK)

## Units

- Lengths should use millimeters

## Classes

- Always initialise private class attributes
- When calling a method from within its class, use this->method()
- When using an attribute of a class, use this->attribute
- All header files should include all of the includes for every function and class used
